Lab 2. Connecting to Data in Tableau 
=============================


Tableau offers the ability to connect to nearly any data source. It does
this with a unique paradigm that leverages the power and efficiency of
existing database engines or alternately extracts the data locally.
We\'ll look at joins, blends, unions.
In this lab, we\'ll focus on essential concepts of how Tableau
connects to and works with data. We\'ll cover the following topics:

-   The Tableau paradigm
-   Connecting to data
-   Managing data source metadata
-   Working with extracts instead of live connections
-   Filtering data

We\'ll start by gaining an understanding of the underlying paradigm of
how Tableau works with data.

### The Tableau paradigm

The unique and exciting experience of working with
data in Tableau is a result of **VizQL** (**Visual Query Language**).

One of the benefits of VizQL is that it provides a common way of
describing how the arrangement of various fields in a view defines a
query related to the data. This common baseline
can then be translated into numerous flavors of SQL, MDX, and **Tableau Query Language** (**TQL**, used for extracted data). Tableau will
automatically perform the translation of VizQL
into a native query to be run by the source data engine.

In its simplest form, the Tableau paradigm of working with data looks
like the following diagram:

![](./images/B16021_02_01.png)

Figure 2.1: The basic Tableau paradigm for working with data

Let\'s look at how this paradigm works in a practical example.

A simple example 
----------------

Open the `Chapter 02 Starter.twbx` workbook
located in the `tableau-2020\Lab 02`
directory and navigate to the `Tableau Paradigm`
sheet. That view was created by dropping the
**Region** dimension on **Columns** and the **Sales** measure on
**Rows**. Here is a screenshot:

![](./images/B16021_02_02.png)

Figure 2.2: This bar chart is the result of a query that returned four
aggregate rows of data

The view is defined by two fields. **Region** is the only dimension,
which means it defines the level of detail in the view and slices the
measure so that there will be a bar per region. **Sales** is used as a
measure aggregated by summing each sale within each region. (Notice also
that **Region** is discrete, resulting in column **headers** while
**Sales** is continuous, resulting in an **axis**.)

For the purpose of this example (although the principle is applicable to
any data source), let\'s say you were connected live to a SQL Server
database with the `Superstore` data stored in a
table. When you first create the preceding screenshot, Tableau generates
a VizQL script, which is translated into an SQL script and sent to the
SQL Server. The SQL Server database engine evaluates the query and
returns aggregated results to Tableau, which are then rendered visually.

The entire process would look something like the following diagram in
Tableau\'s paradigm:

![](./images/B16021_02_03.png)

Figure 2.3: Tableau generated the bar chart in the previous image using
a paradigm like this

There may have been hundreds, thousands, or even
millions of rows of sales data in SQL Server. However, when SQL Server
processes the query, it returns aggregate results. In this case, SQL
Server returns only four aggregate rows of data to Tableau---one row for
each region.

**Tip:**

On occasion, a database administrator may want to find out what scripts
are running against a certain database to debug performance issues or to
determine more efficient indexing or data structures. Many databases
supply profiling utilities or log execution of queries. In addition, you
can find SQL or MDX generated by Tableau in the logs located in the
`My Tableau Repository\Logs` directory.

You may also use Tableau\'s built-in **Performance Recorder** to locate the queries that have been executed. From the top
menu, select **Help \| Settings and Performance \| Start Performance Recording**, then interact with a view, and finally, stop the recording
from the menu. Tableau will open a dashboard that will allow you to see
tasks, performance, and queries that were executed during the recording
session.


To see the aggregate data that Tableau used to draw the view, press
*Ctrl +* *A* to select all the bars, and then
right-click one of them and select **View Data**.

![](./images/B16021_02_04.png)

Figure 2.4: Use the View Data tooltip option to see a summary or
underlying data for a mark

This will reveal a **View Data** window:

![](./images/B16021_02_05.png)

Figure 2.5: The Summary tab displays the aggregate data Tableau used to
render each mark in the view

The **View Data** screen allows you to observe the data in the view. The
**Summary** tab displays the aggregate-level data
that was used to render the view. The **Sales** values here are the sum
of sales for each region. When you click the **Full Data** (previously
named **Underlying**) tab, Tableau will query the data source to
retrieve all the records that make up the aggregate records. In this
case, there are **9,426** underlying records, as indicated on the status
bar in the lower-right corner of the following screenshot:

![](./images/B16021_02_06.png)

Figure 2.6: The Full Data tab reveals the row-level data in the database

Tableau did not need **9,426** records to draw the view and did not
request them from the data source until the **Full Data** data tab was
clicked.

Database engines are optimized to perform aggregations on data.
Typically, these database engines are also located on powerful servers.
Tableau leverages the optimization and power of the underlying data
source. In this way, Tableau can visualize massive datasets with
relatively little local processing of the data.

Additionally, Tableau will only query the data source when you make
changes requiring a new query or a view refresh.
Otherwise, it will use the aggregate results stored in a local cache, as
illustrated here:

![](./images/B16021_02_07.png)

Figure 2.7: The first rendering with a given set of fields queries the
data source directly. Subsequent renderings will query the cache, even
if the same fields are re-arranged in the view

In the preceding example, the query with **Region** as a dimension and
the sum of **Sales** as a measure will only be issued once to the data
source. When the four rows of aggregated results are returned, they are
stored in the cache. After the initial rendering, if you were to move
**Region** to another visual encoding shelf, such as color, or **Sales**
to a different visual encoding shelf, such as size, then Tableau will
retrieve the aggregated rows from the cache and simply re-render the
view.

**Tip:**

You can force Tableau to bypass the cache and refresh the data from a
data source by pressing *F5* or selecting your data source from the
**Data** menu and selecting **Refresh**. Do this any time you want a
view to reflect the most recent changes in a live data source.


If you were to introduce new fields into the view
that did not have cached results, Tableau would send a new query to the
data source, retrieve the aggregated results, and add those results to
the cache.

### Connecting to data

There is virtually no limit to the data that Tableau can visualize!
Almost every new version of Tableau adds new
native connectors. Tableau continues to add native
connectors for cloud-based data. The **web data connector** allows you
to write a connector for any online data you wish to retrieve. The
**Tableau Hyper API** allows you to
programmatically read and write extracts of data, enabling you to access
data from any source and write it to a native Tableau format.
Additionally, for any database without a built-in connection, Tableau
gives you the ability to use a generic **ODBC**
connection.

You may have multiple data sources in the same workbook. Each source
will show up under the **Data** tab on the left sidebar.

**Note:**

Although the terms are often used interchangeably, it is helpful to make
a distinction. A **connection** technically refers
to the connection made to data in a single location, such as tables in a
single database, or files of the same type in the same directory
structure. A **data source** may contain more than
one connection that can be joined together, such as a table in SQL
Server joined to tables in a Snowflake database that are joined to an
Excel table. You can think about it this way: a Tableau workbook may
contain one or more data sources and each data source may contain one or
more connections. We\'ll maintain this distinction throughout the book.


This section will focus on a few practical examples of connecting to
various data sources. There\'s no way to cover every possible type of
connection but we will cover several that are representative
of others. You may or may not have access to some
of the data sources in the following examples. Don\'t worry if you
aren\'t able to follow each example. Merely observe the differences.

Connecting to data in a file 
----------------------------

File-based data includes all sources of data where
the data is stored in a file. File-based data sources include the
following:

-   **Extracts**: A `.hyper` or
    `.tde` file containing
    data that was extracted from an original source.
-   **Microsoft Access**: An `.mdb` or
    `.accdb` database file
    created in Access.
-   **Microsoft Excel:** An `.xls`,
    `.xlsx`, or `.xlsm`
    spreadsheet created in Excel. Multiple Excel sheets
    or sub-tables may be joined or unioned
    together in a single connection.
-   **Text file**: A delimited text file, most
    commonly `.txt`,
    `.csv`, or `.tab`.
    Multiple text files in a single directory may be joined or unioned
    together in a single connection.
-   **Local cube file**: A `.cub` file
    that contains multi-dimensional data. These
    files are typically exported from OLAP databases.
-   **Adobe PDF**: A `.pdf` file that
    may contain tables of data that can be parsed
    by Tableau.
-   **Spatial file**: A wide variety of spatial
    formats are supported such as `.kml`,
    `.shp`, `.tab`,
    `.mif`, spatial JSON, and ESRI database
    files. These formats contain spatial objects that can be rendered by
    Tableau.
-   **Statistical file**: A `.sav`,
    `.sas7bdat`, `.rda`,
    or `.rdata` file generated by statistical
    tools, such as SAS or R.
-   **JSON** **file**: A `.json` file
    that contains data in JSON format.

In addition to those mentioned previously, you can connect to Tableau
files to import connections that you have saved in another Tableau
workbook (`.twb` or
`.twbx`). The connection will be imported, and
changes will only affect the current workbook.

Follow this example to see a connection to an Excel file:

1.  Navigate to the **Connect to Excel** sheet in the
    `Chapter 02 Starter.twbx` workbook.
2.  From the menu, select **Data \| New Data Source** and select
    **Microsoft Excel** from the list of possible connections.
3.  In the open dialogue, open the
    `Superstore.xlsx` file from the
    `tableau-2020\Lab 02` directory.
    Tableau will open the **Data Source** screen. You should see the two
    sheets of the Excel document listed on the left.
4.  Double-click the **Orders** sheet and then the **Returns** sheet.
    Tableau will prompt you with an **Edit Relationship** dialog. We\'ll
    cover relationships in depth in *Lab 13*, *Understanding the
    Tableau Data Model, Joins, and Blends*. For now, accept the defaults
    by closing the dialog.

Your data source screen should look similar to the
following screenshot:

![](./images/B16021_02_08.png)

Figure 2.8: The data source screen with two objects (Orders and Returns)

Take some time to familiarize yourself with the **Data Source** screen
interface, which has the following features (numbered in the preceding
screenshot):

-   **Toolbar**: The toolbar has a few of the familiar controls,
    including undo, redo, and save. It also includes the option to
    refresh the current data source.
-   **Connections**: All the connections in the current data source.
    Click **Add** to add a new connection to the current data source.
    This allows you to join data across different connection types. Each
    connection will be color-coded so that you can distinguish what data
    is coming from which connection.
-   **Sheets (or Tables)**: This lists all the tables of data available
    for a given connection. This includes sheets, sub-tables, and named
    ranges for Excel; tables, views, and stored procedures for
    relational databases; and other connection-dependent options, such
    as **New Union** or **Custom SQL**.
-   **Data Source Name**: This is the name of the currently selected
    data source. You may select a different data source using the
    drop-down arrow next to the database icon. You may click the name of
    the data source to edit it.
-   **Object / Data Model Canvas**: Drop sheets and tables from the left
    into this area to make them part of the connection. You may add
    additional tables by dragging and dropping or double-clicking them.
    Each will be added as an object to the object model. You may
    also add tables as unions or double-click an
    object to edit the underlying tables and joins. We\'ll cover the
    details extensively in *Lab 13*, *Understanding the Tableau Data
    Model, Joins, and Blends*. For now, simply note that Orders and
    Returns are related together by the Order ID.
-   **Live** **or** **Extract** **Options**: For many data sources, you
    may choose whether you would like to have a live connection or an
    extracted connection. We\'ll look at these in further detail later
    in the lab.
-   **Data Source** **Filters**: You may add filters to the data source.
    These will be applied at the data-source level, and thus to all
    views of the data using this data source in the workbook.
-   **Preview Pane Options**: These options allow you to specify whether
    you\'d like to see a preview of the data or a list of metadata, and
    how you would like to preview the data (examples include alias
    values, hidden fields shown, and how many rows you\'d like to
    preview).
-   **Preview Pane/Metadata View**: Depending on your selection in the
    options, this space either displays a preview of data or a list of
    all fields with additional metadata. Notice that these views give
    you a wide array of options, such as changing data types, hiding or
    renaming fields, and applying various data transformation functions.
    We\'ll consider some of these options in this and later labs.

**Tip:**

Once you have created and configured your data source, you may click any
sheet to start using it.


Conclude this exercise with the following steps:

1.  Click the data source name to edit the text and rename the data
    source to `Orders and Returns`.


1.  Navigate to the **Connect to Excel** sheet and, using the
    `Orders and Returns` data source, create a
    time series showing **Returns (Count)** by
    **Return Reason**. Your view should look like the following
    screenshot:

    ![](./images/B16021_02_09.png)

    Figure 2.9: The number of returns by return reason

If you need to edit the connection at any time, select **Data** from the
menu, locate your connection, and then select **Edit Data Source\...**.
Alternately, you may right-click any data source under the **Data** tab
on the left sidebar and select **Edit Data Source\...**, or click the
**Data Source** tab in the lower-left corner. You may access the data
source screen at any time by clicking the **Data Source** tab in the
lower-left corner of Tableau Desktop.

Connecting to data on a server 
------------------------------

Database servers, such as SQL Server, Snowflake, Vertica, and Oracle,
host data on one or more server machines and use
powerful database engines to store, aggregate, sort, and serve data
based on queries from client applications. Tableau can leverage the
capabilities of these servers to retrieve data for visualization and
analysis. Alternately, data can be extracted from these sources and
stored in an extract.

As an example of connecting to a server data source, we\'ll demonstrate
connecting to SQL Server. If you have access to a server-based data
source, you may wish to create a new data source and explore the
details. However, this specific example is not included in the workbook
in this lab.

As soon as the Microsoft SQL Server connection is selected, the
interface displays options for some initial configuration as follows:

![](./images/B16021_02_10.png)

Figure 2.10: The connection editor for Microsoft SQL Server

A connection to SQL Server requires the **Server** name, as well as
authentication information.

A database administrator can configure SQL Server to **Use Windows
Authentication** or a SQL Server username and
password. With SQL Server, you can also optionally allow reading
uncommitted data. This can potentially improve performance but may also
lead to unpredictable results if data is being inserted, updated, or
deleted at the same time as Tableau is querying. Additionally, you may
specify SQL to be run at connect time using the **Initial SQL\...** link
in the lower-left corner.

**Note:**

In order to maintain high standards of security, Tableau will not save a
password as part of a data source connection. This means that if you
share a workbook using a live connection with someone else, they will
need to have credentials to access the data. This also means that when
you first open the workbook, you will need to re-enter your password for
any connections requiring a password.


Once you click the orange **Sign In** button, you will see a screen that
is very similar to the connection screen you saw for Excel. The main
difference is on the left, where you have an option for selecting a
**Database**, as shown in the following screenshot:

![](./images/B16021_02_11.png)

Figure 2.11: Once connected to a database, Tableau will display tables,
views, and stored procedures as options to add to the object model

Once you\'ve selected a database, you will see the
following:

-   **Table**: This shows any data tables or views contained in the
    selected database.
-   **New Custom SQL**: You may write your own custom SQL scripts and
    add them as tables. You may join these as you would any other table
    or view.
-   **New Union**: You may union together tables in the database.
    Tableau will match fields based on name and data type, and you may
    additionally merge fields as needed.
-   **Stored Procedures**: You may use a stored procedure that returns a
    table of data. You will be given the option of setting values for
    stored procedure parameters or using or creating a Tableau parameter
    to pass values.

Once you have finished configuring the connection, click a tab for any
sheet to begin visualizing the data.

Using extracts 
--------------

Any data source that is using an extract will have
a distinctive icon that indicates the data has been pulled from an
original source into an extract, as shown in the following screenshot:

![](./images/B16021_02_12.png)

Figure 2.12: The icon next to a data source indicates whether it is
extracted or not

The first data connection in the preceding data pane is extracted, while
the second is not. After an extract has been created, you may choose to
use the extract or not. When you right-click a data source (or **Data**
from the menu and then the data source), you will see the following menu
options:

![](./images/B16021_02_13.png)

Figure 2.13: The context menu for a data connection in the Data pane
with Extract options numbered

Let\'s cover them in more detail:

1.  **Refresh**: The **Refresh** option under the data source simply
    tells Tableau to refresh the local cache of
    data. With a live data source, this would re-query the underlying
    data. With an extracted source, the cache is cleared and the extract
    is required, but this **Refresh** option does not update the extract
    from the original source. To do that, use **Refresh** under the
    **Extract** sub-menu (see number 4 in this list).
2.  **Extract Data\...**: This creates a new extract from the data
    source (replacing an existing extract if it exists).
3.  **Use Extract**: This option is enabled if there is an extract for a
    given data source. Unchecking the option will tell Tableau to use a
    live connection instead of the extract. The extract will not be
    removed and may be used again by checking this option at any time.
    If the original data source is not available to this workbook,
    Tableau will ask where to find it.
4.  **Refresh**: This **Refresh** option refreshes the extract with data
    from the original source. It does not optimize the extract for some
    changes you make (such as hiding fields or creating new
    calculations).
5.  **Append Data from File\...** or **Append Data from Data
    Source...**:These options allow you to append additional files or
    data sources to an existing extract, provided they have the same
    exact data structure as the original source. This adds rows to your
    existing extract; it will not add new columns.
6.  **Compute Calculations Now**: This will restructure the extract,
    based on changes you\'ve made since originally creating the extract,
    to make it as efficient as possible. Certain calculated fields may
    be *materialized* (that is, calculated once so that the
    resulting value can be stored) and newly
    hidden columns or deleted calculations will be removed from the
    extract.
7.  **Remove**: This removes the definition of the extract, optionally
    deletes the extract file, and resumes a live connection to the
    original data source.
8.  **History**: This allows you to view the history of the extract and
    refreshes.
9.  **Properties**: This enables you to view the properties of the
    extract, such as the location, underlying source, filters, and row
    limits.

Let\'s next consider the performance ramifications of using extracts.

Connecting to data in the cloud 
-------------------------------

Certain data connections are made to data that is
hosted in the cloud. These include **Amazon RDS**,
**Google BigQuery**, **Microsoft SQL Azure**, **Snowflake**,
**Salesforce**, **Google Sheets**, and many others. As an example of a cloud data source, we\'ll
consider connecting to Google Sheets.

Google Sheets allows users to create and maintain spreadsheets of data
online. Sheets may be shared and collaborated on by many different
users. Here, we\'ll walk through an example of connecting to a sheet
that is shared via a link.

To follow the example, you\'ll need a free Google account. With your
credentials, follow these steps:

1.  Click the **Add new data source** button on the toolbar, as shown
    here:

    ![](./images/B16021_02_14.png)

    Figure 2.14: The Add Data button

2.  Select **Google Sheets** from the list of possible data sources. You
    may use the search box to quickly narrow the
    list.


1.  On the next screen, sign in to your Google account and allow Tableau
    Desktop the appropriate permissions. You will then be presented with
    a list of all your Google Sheets, along with preview and search
    capabilities, as shown in the following screenshot:

    ![](./images/B16021_02_15.png)

    Figure 2.15: You may select any Google Sheet you have permissions to
    view or you may enter the URL for a shared sheet


1.  Enter the following URL (for convenience, it
    is included in the `Chapter 02 Starter`
    workbook in the **Connect to Google Sheets** tab, and may be copied
    and pasted) into the search box and click the **Search** button:
    [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fWMGkPt0o7sdbW50tG4QLSZDwkjNO9X0mCkw-LKYu1A/edit?usp=sharing]{.url}](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fWMGkPt0o7sdbW50tG4QLSZDwkjNO9X0mCkw-LKYu1A/edit?usp=sharing):

2.  Select the resulting `Superstore` sheet in
    the list and then click the **Connect** button. You should now see
    the **Data Source** screen.

3.  Click the **Data Source** name to rename it to
    `Superstore (Google Sheets)`:

    ![](./images/B16021_02_16.png)

    Figure 2.16: Renaming a Data Source

4.  For the purpose of this example, switch the
    connection option from **Live** to **Extract**. When connecting to
    your own Google Sheets data, you may choose either **Live** or
    **Extract**:

    ![](./images/B16021_02_17.png)

    Figure 2.17: Switch between Live and Extract, Edit extract options,
    and Add Filters

5.  Click the tab for the **Connect to Google Sheets** sheet. You will
    be prompted for a location to save the extract. Accept the default
    name and save it in the
    `Learning Tableau\Chapter 02` directory
    (selecting **Yes** to overwrite the existing file if needed). The
    data should be extracted within a few seconds.


1.  Create a filled map of **Profit** by **State**, with **Profit**
    defining the **Color** and **Label**:

    ![](./images/B16021_02_18.png)

    Figure 2.18: The filled map demonstrates the ability to connect to a
    cloud-based data source

**Note:**

If your location is outside the United States, you may need to change
your regional settings for Tableau to properly show the states in the
map. Use the menu and select **File** \| **Workbook Locale** \| **More**
and select **English (United States)**.


Now that we\'ve seen a few specific examples of
connecting to data, let\'s consider some shortcuts and how to manage our
data sources.

Shortcuts for connecting to data 
--------------------------------

You can make certain connections very quickly.
These options will allow you to begin analyzing more quickly:

-   Paste data from the clipboard. If you have copied data in your
    system\'s clipboard from any source (for example, a spreadsheet, a
    table on a web page, or a text file), you can then paste the data
    directly into Tableau. This can be done using *Ctrl + V*, or **Data
    \| Paste Data** from the menu. The data will be stored as a file and
    you will be alerted to its location when you save the workbook.
-   Select **File \| Open** from the menu. This will allow you to open
    any data file that Tableau supports, such as text files, Excel
    files, Access files (not available on macOS), spatial files,
    statistical files, JSON, and even offline cube
    (`.cub`) files.
-   Drag and drop a file from Windows Explorer or
    Finder onto the Tableau workspace. Any valid file-based data source
    can be dropped onto the Tableau workspace or even the Tableau
    shortcut on your desktop or taskbar.
-   Duplicate an existing data source. You can duplicate an existing
    data source by right-clicking and selecting **Duplicate**.

These shortcuts provide a quick way for analyzing the data you need.
Let\'s turn our attention to managing the data sources.

### Managing data source metadata

Data sources in Tableau store information about
the connection(s). In addition to the connection itself (for example,
database server name, database, and/or filenames), the data source also
contains information about all the fields available (such as field name,
data type, default format, comments, and aliases). Often, this *data
about the data* is referred to as **metadata**.

Right-clicking a field in the data pane reveals a
menu of metadata options. Some of these options will be demonstrated in
a later exercise; others will be explained throughout the book. These
are some of the options available via right-clicking:

-   Renaming the field
-   Hiding the field
-   Changing aliases for values of a non-date dimension
-   Creating calculated fields, groups, sets, bins, or parameters
-   Splitting the field
-   Changing the default use of a date or numeric field to either
    discrete or continuous
-   Redefining the field as a dimension or a measure
-   Changing the data type of the field
-   Assigning a geographic role to the field
-   Changing defaults for how a field is displayed in a visualization,
    such as the default colors and shapes, number or date format, sort
    order (for dimensions), or type of aggregation (for measures)
-   Adding a default comment for a field (which will be shown as a
    tooltip when hovering over a field in the data pane, or shown as
    part of the description when **Describe\...** is selected from the
    menu)
-   Adding or removing the field from a hierarchy

**Tip:**

Metadata options that relate to the visual display of the field, such as
default sort order or default number format, define the overall default
for a field. However, you can override the defaults in any individual
view by right-clicking the active field on the shelf and selecting the
desired options.


To see how this works, use the filled map view of
`Profit` by `State` that
you created in the **Connect to Google Sheets** view. If you did not
create this view, you may use the **Orders and Returns** data source,
though the resulting view will be slightly different. With the filled
map in front of you, follow these steps:

1.  Right-click the **Profit** field in the data pane and select
    **Default Properties** \| **Number Format\...**. The resulting
    dialog gives you many options for numeric format.

2.  Set the number format to **Currency (Custom)** with
    `0` **Decimal places** and the **Display
    Units** in `Thousands (K)`. After clicking
    **OK**, you should notice that the labels on the map have updated to
    include currency notation:

    ![](./images/B16021_02_19.png)

    Figure 2.19: Editing the default number format of a field


1.  Right-click the **Profit** field again and
    select **Default properties** \| **Color\...**. The resulting dialog
    gives you an option to select and customize the default color
    encoding of the **Profit** field. Experiment with various palettes
    and settings. Notice that every time you click the **Apply** button,
    the visualization updates.

**Tip:**

Diverging palettes (palettes that blend from one color to another) work
particularly well for fields such as **Profit**, which can have negative
and positive values. The default center of `0`
allows you to easily tell what values are positive or negative based on
the color shown.

Figure 2.20: Customizing color

Because you have set the default format for the
field at the data-source level, any additional views you create using
**Profit** will include the default formatting you specified.

**Tip:**

Consider using color blind-safe colors in your visualizations. Orange
and blue are usually considered a color blind-safe alternative to red
and green. Tableau also includes a discrete color blind-safe palette.
Additionally, consider adjusting the intensity of the colors, using
labels, or different visualizations to make your visualizations more
accessible.


### Working with extracts instead of live connections

Nearly all data sources allow the option of either
connecting live or extracting the data. A few cloud-based data sources
require an extract. Conversely, OLAP data sources cannot be extracted
and require live connections.

Extracts extend the way in which Tableau works with data. Consider the
following diagram:

![](./images/B16021_02_21.png)

Figure 2.21: Data from the original Data Source is extracted into a
self-contained snapshot of the data

When using a live connection, Tableau issues
queries directly to the data source (or uses data in the cache, if
possible). When you extract the data, Tableau pulls some or all of the
data from the original source and stores it in an extract file. Prior to
version 10.5, Tableau used a Tableau Data Extract
(`.tde`) file. Starting with version 10.5,
Tableau uses Hyper extracts (`.hyper`) and will
convert `.tde` files to
`.hyper` as you update older workbooks.

The fundamental paradigm of how Tableau works with data does not change,
but you\'ll notice that Tableau is now querying and getting results from
the extract. Data can be retrieved from the source
again to refresh the extract. Thus, each extract is a snapshot of the
data source at the time of the latest refresh. Extracts offer the
benefit of being portable and extremely efficient.

Creating extracts 
-----------------

Extracts can be created in multiple ways, as
follows:

-   Select **Extract** on the **Data Source** screen as follows. The
    **Edit\...** link will allow you to configure the extract:

    ![](./images/B16021_02_22.png)

    Figure 2.22: Select either Live or Extract for a connection and
    configure options for the extract by clicking Edit.


-   Select the data source from the **Data** menu, or right-click the
    data source on the data pane and select **Extract data**. You will
    be given a chance to set configuration options for the extract, as
    demonstrated in the following screenshot:

    ![](./images/B16021_02_23.png)

    Figure 2.23: The Extract data... option


-   Developers may create an extract using the Tableau Hyper API. This
    API allows you to use Python, Java, C++, or C\#/.NET to
    programmatically read and write Hyper extracts.

You\'ll have quite a few options for configuring
an extract. To edit these options, select **Extract** and then
**Edit...** on the **Data Source** screen or **Extract data...** from
the context menu of a connection in the **Data** pane. When you
configure an extract, you will be prompted to select certain options, as
shown here:

![](./images/B16021_02_24.png)

Figure 2.24: The Extract Data dialog gives quite a few options for how
to configure the extract

You have a great deal of control when configuring an extract. Here are
the various options, and the impact your choices will make on
performance and flexibility:

-   Depending on the data source and object model you\'ve created, you
    may select between **Logical Tables** and **Physical Tables**.
    We\'ll explore the details in *Lab 13*, *Understanding the
    Tableau Data Model, Joins, and Blends*.
-   You may optionally add extract **Filters**, which limit the extract
    to a subset of the original source. In this example only, records
    where **Region** is **Central** or **South** and where **Category**
    is **Office Machines** will be included in the extract.
-   You may aggregate an extract by checking the box. This means that
    data will be rolled up to the level of visible dimensions and,
    optionally, to a specified date level, such as year or month.
    **Note:**

    **Visible fields** are those that are shown in
    the data pane. You may hide a field from the Data Source screen or
    from the data pane by right-clicking a field and selecting **Hide**.
    This option will be disabled if the field is used in any view in the
    workbook. `Hidden` fields are not available
    to be used in a view. `Hidden` fields are not
    included in an extract as long as they are hidden prior to creating
    or optimizing the extract.
    

In the preceding example, if only the **Region**
and **Category** dimensions were visible, the resulting extract would
only contain two rows of data (one row for **Central** and another for
**South**). Additionally, any measures would be aggregated at the
**Region**/**Category** level and would be done with respect to the
**Extract** filters. For example, **Sales** would be rolled up to the
sum of sales in **Central**/**Office Machines** and **South**/**Office
Machines**. All measures are aggregated according to their default
aggregation.

You may adjust the number of rows in the extract by including all rows
or a sampling of the top *n* rows in the dataset. If you select all
rows, you can indicate an incremental refresh. If your source data
incrementally adds records, and you have a field such as an identity
column or date field that can be used reliably to identify new records
as they are added, then an incremental extract can allow you to add
those records to the extract without recreating the entire extract. In
the preceding example, any new rows where **Row ID** is higher than the
highest value of the previous extract refresh would be included in the
next incremental refresh.

**Tip:**

Incremental refreshes can be a great way to deal with large volumes of
data that grow over time. However, use incremental refreshes with care,
because the incremental refresh will only add new rows of data based on
the field you specify. You won\'t get changes to existing rows, nor will
rows be removed if they were deleted at the source. You will also miss
any new rows if the value for the incremental field is less than the
maximum value in the existing extract.


Now that we\'ve considered how to create and
configure extracts, let\'s turn our attention to using them.

Performance 
-----------

There are two types of
extracts in Tableau:

-   Tableau Data Extracts (`.tde` files): prior
    to Tableau 10.5, these were the only type of extract available.
-   Hyper (`.hyper` files) are available in
    Tableau 10.5 or later.

Depending on scale and volume, both `.hyper` and
`.tde` extracts may perform faster than most
traditional live database connections. For the most part, Tableau will
default to creating Hyper extracts. Unless you are using older versions
of Tableau, there is little reason to use the older
`.tde`. The incredible performance of Tableau
extracts is based on several factors, including the following:

-   Hyper extracts make use of a hybrid of OLTP and OLAP models and the
    engine determines the optimal query. Tableau Data Extracts are
    columnar and very efficient to query.
-   Extracts are structured so they can be loaded quickly into memory
    without additional processing and moved between memory and disk
    storage, so the size is not limited to the amount of RAM available,
    but RAM is efficiently used to boost performance.
-   Many calculated fields are materialized in the extract. The
    pre-calculated value stored in the extract can often be read faster
    than executing the calculation every time the query is executed.
    Hyper extracts extend this by potentially materializing many
    aggregations.

You may choose to use extracts to increase performance over traditional
databases. To maximize your performance gain, consider the following
actions:

-   Prior to creating the extract, hide unused fields. If you have
    created all desired visualizations, you can click the **Hide Unused Fields** button on the **Extract** dialog to hide all fields not
    used in any view or calculation.
-   If possible, use a subset of data from the original source. For
    example, if you have historical data for the last 10 years but only
    need the last two years for analysis, then filter the extract by the
    `Date` field.
-   Optimize an extract after creating or editing
    calculated fields or deleting or hiding fields.
-   Store extracts on solid-state drives.

Although performance is one major reason to consider using extracts,
there are other factors to consider, which we will do next.

Portability and security 
------------------------

Let\'s say that your data is hosted on a database server accessible only
from inside your office network. Normally, you\'d have to be onsite or
using a VPN to work with the data. Even cloud-based
data sources require an internet connection. With
an extract, you can take the data with you and work offline.

An extract file contains data extracted from the source. When you save a
workbook, you may save it as a Tableau workbook
(`.twb`) file or a Tableau Packaged Workbook
(`.twbx`) file. Let\'s consider the difference:

-   A Tableau workbook (`.twb`) contains
    definitions for all the connections, fields, visualizations, and
    dashboards, but does not contain any data or external files, such as
    images. A Tableau workbook can be edited in Tableau Desktop and
    published to Tableau Server.
-   A Tableau packaged workbook (`.twbx`)
    contains everything in a (`.twb`) file but
    also includes extracts and external files that are packaged together
    in a single file with the workbook. A packaged workbook using
    extracts can be opened with Tableau Desktop, Tableau Reader, and
    published to Tableau Public or Tableau Online.

**Tip:**

A packaged workbook file (`.twbx`) is really just
a compressed `.zip` file. If you rename the
extension from `.twbx` to
`.zip`, you can access the contents as you would
any other `.zip` file.


There are a couple of security considerations to keep in mind when using
an extract. First, any security layers that limit which data can be
accessed according to the credentials used will not be effective after
the extract is created. An extract does not require a username or
password. All data in an extract can be read by anyone. Second, any data
for visible (non-hidden) fields contained in an extract file
(`.hyper` or `.tde`), or
an extract contained in a packaged workbook
(`.twbx`), can be accessed even if the data is
not shown in the visualization. Be very careful to limit access to
extracts or packaged workbooks containing sensitive or proprietary data.

When to use an extract 
----------------------

You should consider various factors when
determining whether to use an extract. In some cases, you won\'t have an
option (for example, OLAP requires a live connection and some
cloud-based data sources require an extract). In other cases, you\'ll
want to evaluate your options.

In general, use an extract when:

-   You need better performance than you can get with the live
    connection.
-   You need the data to be portable.
-   You need to use functions that are not supported by the database
    data engine (for example, `MEDIAN` is not
    supported with a live connection to SQL Server).
-   You want to share a packaged workbook. This is especially true if
    you want to share a packaged workbook with someone who uses the free
    Tableau Reader, which can only read packaged workbooks with data
    extracted.

In general, do not use an extract when you have
any of the following use cases:

-   You have sensitive data that should not be accessible by certain
    users, or you have no control over who will be able to access the
    extract. However, you may hide sensitive fields prior to creating
    the extract, in which case they are no longer part of the extract.
-   You need to manage security based on login credentials. (However, if
    you are using Tableau Server, you may still use extracted
    connections hosted on Tableau Server that are secured by a login.
    We\'ll consider sharing your work with Tableau Server in *Lab
    16*, *Sharing Your Data Story*).
-   You need to see changes in the source data updated in real time.
-   The volume of data makes the time required to build the extract
    impractical. The number of records that can be extracted in a
    reasonable amount of time will depend on factors such as the data
    types of fields, the number of fields, the speed of the data source,
    and network bandwidth. The Hyper engine typically builds
    `.hyper` extracts much faster than the older
    `.tde` files were built.

With an understanding of how to create, manage,
and use extracts (and when not to use them), we\'ll turn our attention
to various ways of filtering data in Tableau.


### Filtering data


Often, you will want to filter data in Tableau in
order to perform an analysis on a subset of data, narrow your focus, or
drill into details. Tableau offers multiple ways to filter data.

If you want to limit the scope of your analysis to a subset of data, you
can filter the data at the source using one of the following techniques:

-   **Data Source Filters** are applied before all
    other filters and are useful when you want to limit your analysis to
    a subset of data. These filters are applied before any other
    filters.
-   **Extract Filters** limit the data that is
    stored in an extract (`.tde` or
    `.hyper`). Data source filters are often
    converted into extract filters if they are present when you extract
    the data.
-   **Custom SQL Filters** can be accomplished
    using a live connection with custom SQL, which has a Tableau
    parameter in the `WHERE` clause. We\'ll
    examine parameters in *Lab 4*, *Starting an Adventure with
    Calculations and Parameters*.

Additionally, you can apply filters to one or more views using one of
the following techniques:

-   Drag and drop fields from the data pane to the **Filters** shelf.
-   Select one or more marks or headers in a view and then select **Keep
    Only** or **Exclude**, as shown here:

![](./images/B16021_02_25.png)

Figure 2.25: Based on the mark selection, you may Keep Only values that
match or Exclude such values.

-   Right-click any field in the data pane or in the view and select
    **Show Filter**. The filter will be shown as a control (examples
    include a drop-down list and checkbox) to allow the end user of the
    view or dashboard the ability to change the filter.
-   Use an action filter. We\'ll look more at filters and action filters
    in the context of dashboards.

Each of these options adds one or more fields to the **Filters** shelf
of a view. When you drop a field on the **Filters** shelf, you will be
prompted with options to define the filter. The filter
options will differ most noticeably based on
whether the field is discrete or continuous. Whether a field is filtered
as a dimension or as a measure will greatly impact how the filter is
applied and the results.

Filtering discrete (blue) fields 
--------------------------------

When you filter using a discrete field, you will
be given options for selecting individual values to keep or exclude. For
example, when you drop the discrete **Department** dimension onto the
**Filters** shelf, Tableau will give you the following options:

![](./images/B16021_02_26.png)

Figure 2.26: A filter for a discrete field will show options for
including or excluding individual values

The **Filter** options include **General**, **Wildcard**, **Condition**,
and **Top** tabs. Your filter can include options
from each tab. The **Summary** section on the
**General** tab will show all options selected:

-   The **General** tab allows you to select items from a list (you can
    use the custom list to add items manually if the dimension contains
    a large number of values that take a long time to load). You may use
    the **Exclude** option to exclude the selected items.
-   The **Wildcard** tab allows you to match string values that contain,
    start with, end with, or exactly match a given value.
-   The **Condition** tab allows you to specify conditions based on
    aggregations of other fields that meet conditions (for example, a
    condition to keep any **Department** where the sum of sales was
    greater than \$1,000,000). Additionally, you can write a custom
    calculation to form complex conditions. We\'ll cover calculations
    more in *Lab 4*, *Starting an Adventure with Calculations and
    Parameters*, and *Lab 6*, *Diving Deep with Table Calculations*.
-   The **Top** tab allows you to limit the filter to only the top or
    bottom items. For example, you might decide to keep only the top
    five items by the sum of sales.

**Tip:**

Discrete measures (except for calculated fields using table
calculations) cannot be added to the **Filters** shelf. If the field
holds a date or numeric value, you can convert it to a continuous field
before filtering. Other data types will require the creation of a
calculated field to convert values you wish to filter into continuous
numeric values.


Let\'s next consider how continuous filters are
filtered.

Filtering continuous (green) fields 
-----------------------------------

If you drop a continuous dimension onto the
**Filters** shelf, you\'ll get a different set of options. Often, you
will first be prompted as to how you want to filter the field,
as follows:

![](./images/B16021_02_27.png)

Figure 2.27: For numeric values, you\'ll often see options for
aggregating the value as part of the filter

The options here are divided into two major categories:

-   **All values**: The filter will be based on each individual value of
    the field, *row by row*. For example, an **All values** filter
    keeping only sales above \$100 will evaluate each record of
    underlying data and keep only individual sales above \$100.
-   **Aggregation**: The filter will be based on the aggregation
    specified (for example, **Sum**, **Average**, **Minimum**,
    **Maximum**, **Standard deviation**, and **Variance**) and the
    aggregation will be performed at the level of detail of the view.
    For example, a filter keeping only the sum of sales above \$100,000
    on a view at the level of category will keep only categories that
    had at least \$100,000 in total sales.

Once you\'ve made a selection (or if the selection
wasn\'t applicable for the field selected), you will be given another
interface for setting the actual filter, as follows:

![](./images/B16021_02_28.png)

Figure 2.28: Filter options for Sales (as a SUM)

Here, you\'ll see options for filtering continuous values based on a
range with a start, end, or both. The **Special** tab gives options for
showing all values, `NULL` values, or
non-`NULL` values.

**Tip:**

From a user-interface perspective, the most dramatic difference in
filtering options comes from whether a field is discrete or continuous.
However, you should always think about whether you
are using the field as a **Dimension Filter** or a **Measure Filter** to
understand what kind of results you will get based
on the order of operations, which is discussed in the *Appendix*.

-   Dimension filters will filter *detail rows of data*. For example,
    filtering out the Central Region will eliminate all rows for that
    region. You will not see any states for that region and your
    aggregate results, such as `SUM(Sales)`, will
    not include any values from that region.
-   Measure filters will filter *aggregate rows of data* at the level of
    detail defined by the dimensions included in your view. For example,
    if you filtered to include only where
    `SUM(Sales)` was greater than \$100,000 and
    your view included `Region` and
    `Month`, then the resulting view would
    include only values where the `Region` had
    more than \$100,000 in sales for the given month.


Other than filtering discrete and continuous
fields, you\'ll also notice some different options for filtering dates,
which we\'ll consider next.

Filtering dates 
---------------

We\'ll take a look at the special way Tableau
handles dates in the *Visualizing dates and times* section of *Lab
3*, *Moving Beyond Basic Visualizations*. For now, consider the options
available when you drop an **Order Date** field onto the **Filters**
shelf, as follows:

![](./images/B16021_02_29.png)

Figure 2.29: Initial filter options for a date field

The options here include the following:

-   **Relative date**: This option allows you to filter a date based on
    a specific date (for example, keeping the last three weeks from
    today, or the last six months from January 1).
-   **Range of dates**: This option allows you to filter a date based on
    a range with a starting date, ending date, or both.
-   **Date Part**: This option allows you to filter based on discrete
    parts of dates, such as **Years**, **Months**, **Days**, or
    combinations of parts, such as **Month/Year**. Based on your
    selection, you will have various options for filtering and have the
    option of defaulting to the latest value in the data.
-   **Individual dates**: This option allows you to filter based on each
    individual value of the date field in the data.
-   **Count** or **Count (Distinct)**: This option allows you to filter
    based on the count, or distinct count, of date values in the data.

Depending on your selection, you will be given additional options for
filtering.

Other filtering options 
-----------------------

You will also want to be aware of the following
options when it comes to filtering:

-   You may display a filter control for nearly any field by
    right-clicking it and selecting **Show Filter**. The type of control
    depends on the type of field, whether it is discrete or continuous,
    and may be customized by using the little drop-down arrow at the
    upper-right of the filter control.
-   **Filters** may be added to the **context**. Context is described in
    detail in the *Appendix* and we\'ll see why it\'s important in
    various examples throughout the book. For now, just note the option.
    This option is available via the drop-down menu on the filter
    control or the field on the **Filters** shelf.
-   **Filters** may be set to show all values in the database, all
    values in the context, all values in a hierarchy, or only values
    that are relevant based on other filters. These options are
    available via the drop-down menu on the **Filter** control or the
    field on the **Filters** shelf.
-   When using Tableau Server, you may define user filters that allow
    you to provide row-level security by filtering based on user
    credentials.
-   By default, any field placed on the **Filters** shelf defines a
    filter that is specific to the current view. However, you may
    specify the scope by using the menu for the field on the **Filters**
    shelf. Select **Apply to** and choose one of the following options:
    -   **All related data sources**: All data sources will be filtered
        by the value(s) specified. The relationships of fields are the
        same as blending (that is, the default by name and type match,
        or customized through the **Data \| Edit Relationships\...**
        menu option). All views using any of the related data sources
        will be affected by the filter. This
        option is sometimes referred to as **cross-data source
        filtering**.
    -   **Current data source**: The data source for that field will be
        filtered. Any views using that data source will be affected by
        the filter.
    -   **Selected worksheets**: Any worksheets selected that use the
        data source of the field will be affected by the filter.
    -   **Current worksheet**: Only the current view will be affected by
        the filter.

We\'ll see plenty of practical examples of filtering data throughout the
book, many of which will make use of some of these options.


### Summary
 
This lab covered key concepts of how Tableau works with data.
Although you will not usually be concerned with what queries Tableau
generates to query underlying data engines, having a solid understanding
of Tableau\'s paradigm will greatly aid you as you analyze data.

We looked at multiple examples of different connections to different
data sources, considered the benefits and potential drawbacks of using
data extracts, considered how to manage metadata, and considered options
for filtering data.
